### Description

If you're looking for the most compact li'l color display for a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/category/361) (most likely a [Pi Zero](https://www.adafruit.com/category/813)) project, this might be just the thing you need!

The **Adafruit Mini PiTFT - 135x240 Color TFT Add-on for Raspberry Pi** and the **Adafruit Mini PiTFT - 1.3" 240x240 Color TFT Add-on for Raspberry Pi** are your little TFT pals, ready to snap onto any and all Raspberry Pi computers, to give you a little display. The Mini PiTFT comes with a full color 240x135 or 240x240 pixel IPS display with great visibility at all angles. The TFT uses only the SPI port so its very fast, and we leave plenty of pins remaining available for buttons, LEDs, sensors, etc. It's also nice and compact so it will fit into any case.

This display is super small, only about 1.14" diagonal or 1.3" diagonal, but since it is an IPS display, its very readable with high contrast and visibility. We had a little space on the top so we give you two tactile buttons on GPIO pins so you can create a simple user interface. [On the bottom we have a Qwiic/STEMMA QT connector for I2C sensors and device so you can plug and play any of our STEMMA QT devices](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=stemma%20qt).

Using the display is very easy, we have a kernel driver and Python library for the ST7789 chipset. You can set it up as a console output so you can have text and user interface through the Raspberry Pi OS or you draw images, text, whatever you like, using the Python imaging library. Our tests showed ~15 FPS update rates so you can do animations or simple video.

**Comes completely pre-assembled and tested** so you don't need to do anything but plug it in and install our Python code! **Works with any Raspberry Pi computer.**
